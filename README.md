# i-can-remember
A script to remember notes and recall them.

I am running this script on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS with python 3.5. It works on IDLE and through terminal.
To run via terminal there is a shebang, "#!", on the first line.
It can be removed if not needed, but it must be there to work via terminal.
If you have trouble, check the file permissions.
I'm not sure if permissions transfer over GitHub, but all my local file are 777, with executable permission.
